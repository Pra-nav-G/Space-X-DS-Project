# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Capstone Project

This project is the capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program on Coursera. The goal is to predict whether SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage rockets will land successfully, which directly impacts launch costs and competitive pricing in the commercial space industry.

## üöÄ Project Overview

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches at $62 million, significantly lower than competitors who charge upwards of $165 million. This cost advantage stems from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of their rockets. By predicting first stage landing success, we can estimate launch costs and provide valuable insights for companies bidding against SpaceX.
